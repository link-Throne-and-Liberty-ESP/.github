## 🧬 What Is Throne and Liberty ESP?

ESP is a cheat that overlays game data directly on your screen in real-time. It reveals key info like:

* Player positions

* Chest and loot spawns
* Distance from targets
* Trap placements

And it works from **any angle**—even through walls, rocks, buildings, and terrain.

Basically, it's like having wallhacks, a minimap, and sonar all rolled into one. You’ll never be caught off guard again 💪
